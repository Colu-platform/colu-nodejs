These Terms and Conditions stipulated herein are a binding agreement between Colu Technologies Ltd. (“Colu”), a duly incorporated Israeli corporation, and yourself, either a natural person or a designated representative acting on behalf of a corporation.

The “Colu Platform”, which includes the Colu API, Colu SDK and Colu engine allows you to issue and manage Assets (as defined later in this document) based on the core blockchain technology, which is not managed or owned by Colu. Using the Colu Platform you may issue Assets, manage them, revoke them or otherwise modify their properties.

However, as they are based entirely on the blockchain, which is not managed by Colu, these Assets may be modified and managed also by the use of the bitcoin blockchain, by yourself.

Colu encourages an open platform, and the use of its API in order to provide the services, but does not allow illegal or harmful use. Therefore, you are prohibited from using the Colu Platform in a manner which violates the law, or in a manner which might harm Colu and its property.

The Colu Platform comes with absolutely no warranty, and is meant to be used AS-IS.

Please read the full Terms and Conditions, as they are the sole legal document, and this preamble shall not be used for interpretation.

Registration, Eligibility and Application Terms: The following article sets forth Colu’s eligibility and registration terms. If you are not eligible to register, please do not perform the activation of your account. Should you be found later to be non-eligible, then Colu may terminate your account without notice.
General Information Required To Register: The following information is a prerequisite to enter into these Terms and Conditions: your full name, the Company which you represent (if applicable), and your email. Colu may later request additional information, in order to verify your identity and/or in order to provide additional services.
One Account Per One Entity: Colu’s current policy is that each legal entity shall have only one account with one login. This means that if you are acting on behalf of a corporation, then you may share this account between the corporation’s staff. However, it is your sole responsibility to keep this account secure.
If acting on behalf of a corporation: If you are acting on behalf of a corporation, then you are the authorized entity to enter into these terms and are acting on behalf of such corporation.
Solvency: You are solvent and have not filed for bankruptcy, liquidation, debt arrangement or otherwise lost your ability into entering into agreements such as these terms.
Not Representing An Enemy State: You do not reside in North Korea, Libya, Syria, Iran, or any other jurisdiction where Colu cannot enforce its terms.
Adult: If you are a natural person, you are either over 18, or you are over 13 years of age and have obtained your parental consent.
Password: When using the Colu Platform, you may be required to select a password. The password shall be hashed on Colu’s servers and may be used to encrypt your private key for issuing the Assets. Please take into consideration that if you lose both your password and backup files, then you may not be able to recover access to your Assets, as they are controlled by this private key.
Notification: You are required to inform Colu, immediately, upon any case where you believe that your account was breached and in any case you are in knowledge of any unauthorized use of any Colu account.
Colu’s Liability: Colu shall not be liable in any case where you did not adhere to these security guidelines and shall not be able to assist you in any manner should you refrain from using Colu’s best practices, as published from time to time.
Backup: Colu may allow you to backup your private key to your computer or any other third party service. It shall be your sole responsibility to keep such backup secure, as it allows access to your Assets.
API Key: Colu may provide you with an API (Application Programming Interface) key. Such API key may be used to issue and manage your Assets. It shall be your sole responsibility to keep the API key secure, as it allows access to your Assets.
Activation Link: Following your initial registration, you may be required to activate your account and validate your email by accessing an activation link sent to you.
Services: The following services are a part of the Colu Platform and fully owned by Colu, or duly licensed to it; where Colu may add or deprecate services from time to time, and may withhold a portion of the services. Each of the services may be referred to as a part of the Colu Platform, or as a “Service”.
Issue Assets: Colu may allow you to issue Assets. An “Asset” is a virtual token based on the blockchain technology, which may represent either a token granting access to a specific venue and time (such as a movie ticket), a control of a physical Asset (such as a “certificate of authenticity” for a rare baseball card), or a membership card (such as a gym membership).
Issuance of Assets: Colu may allow you to issue Assets, either using your own set of rules and metadata stored on the Assets (such as the seat of a movie ticket, or dates where the gym membership is applicable) and to control the transferability of the Asset, its divisibility (such as half of a movie ticket versus half ownership of a baseball card), it’s original issuer (yourself), and other options.
Access Assets: Colu may also allow you to issue access Assets. An access Asset is used for online and offline authentication and identity management (such as a gym membership or accessing a website through two-factor authentication).
Use Of Templates: Colu may allow you to use templates generated either by Colu or its users for issuing your Assets. These templates may be provided for free or against a fee, and may or may not be available for modification.
Migration: If you previously issued Assets on different protocols, then Colu may allow you to migrate your Assets to the Colu Platform.
Send Asset: The Colu Platform may allow you to send Assets to users who installed the Colu application or to addresses on the blockchain. Please note that while it is possible to send Assets on top of the blockchain to non-Colu users, it may cause the Asset to be unusable or lost forever.
Manage Asset: Colu may allow you to manage your Assets, and add or remove information from them, as well as adding a data layer on top of such Assets, where you can add additional data to your Asset which is not stored on the blockchain.
Colu Code: Colu may provide you with a specific software code, which includes Colu's proprietary source code, for either the Colu SDK or the Colu Application ("Colu Software"), to be used to integrate the Colu Platform and/or access the Colu API with your products. When doing so, you shall be licensed a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferrable, revocable, temporary, personal license to distribute the Colu Software solely as a part of your own application, provided that your end-users shall accept the Colu application terms of service and shall hold Colu as harmless and exempt from any warranty; moreover, Colu should be credited in all distribution of your application. You may publish small portions of the Colu source code as examples, but you may not distribute the Colu Software source code to any third party, nor may you allow others to create software using the Colu Software for redistribution. You may amend the Colu Software source code as a part of your application, and distribute it to your end-users as a part of a larger work. However, apart where specifically licensed, you are prohibited from using, distributing, publishing, making derivative works, changing, reverse engineering, decompiling or otherwise manipulating the Colu Software. The Colu Software may be offered to you free of charge or against payment, where this License may be revoked at any time by Colu.
Revocation: Colu may allow you to revoke specific Assets (such as lost movie tickets), and to either replace or reissue Assets against revoked Assets.
Analytics: Colu may allow you to review statistical information about the use of your issued Assets. This may include the use of the Assets by other users, the transaction information on the blockchain and your internal use of the Assets.
API: Colu may avail you to API access to the Colu Platform, where you may be able to perform some of the services provided by Colu. In such case, Colu may also monitor and/or review your use of the API as a part of your use of the services.
Generate Templates: Colu may allow you to generate templates for managing Assets, where such template may either be used internally by yourself (such as a theater generating a movie ticket template) or shared with others through the Colu Platform (such as a high school issuing prom tickets and allowing nearby schools to copy it).
Send Messages: Colu may allow you to send messages to Asset holders over the blockchain.
Precaution: Please note that as the actions performed on the Colu Platform are based on the blockchain technology, anyone who holds a copy of your public key may view your transactions.
Fees: In consideration of its services, Colu may charge you fees as set forth in Colu’s fee schedule, which may be amended from time to time. Such fees may include set-up fees, monthly subscriptions, usage fees or overage fees. Colu may determine the means which the fees shall be paid by, such as credit card, PayPal or bitcoins.
Refunds: Colu’s services are provided to you where your purchase of Colu’s services is a payment for services, intangible goods, tailor made goods, or virtual property. Therefore, Colu is not obligated to refund or reimburse you in any way. Colu may personally consider each refund request and may refund according to its sole discretion.
